Assessment
Results including
Age-Appropriate
Transition-based
Assessments
and Student
Strengths:

Transition Assessments are an ongoing process of collecting data on the student’s strengths, preferences, interests and
needs, as they relate to the measurable postsecondary goals (MPSGs) for the student in the areas of independent living,
employment, education, and training.

Measurable postsecondary goals
based on
appropriate
transition
assessments

Education/
Training

Goal Types include Education, Employment, Independent Living Skills. These goals should reflect the desired outcomes
one year after graduation or existing services. If a student is going to attend the Independence Academy or other services
for students 18-21, these goals reflect the year after completion of that individualized programming.

Federal and State guidelines require a minimum of TWO transition assessments updated annually. Describe these in the
Transition Assessment Results section on the Transition Page and align to the MPSGs.
Refer to the LPS Transition Assessment Options Document
General Structure:
●​ Assessment #1, Name of Assessment, Date Given (Modifications if appropriate) - Choose 2-3 priority areas,
identify the strengths, preferences, interests and needs as identified by the assessment
●​ Assessment #2, Name of Assessment, Date Given (Modifications if appropriate) - Choose 2-3 priority areas,
identify the strengths, preferences, interests and needs as identified by the assessment
●​ Summarize additional assessments using the same structure - additional assessments may be needed to explore
areas indicated by student need, parent/guardian input, or present level of performance.

Employment
Independent
Living Skills

Measurable Post-Secondary Goals are developed based on assessment. Students should have input and assist in
development of the MPSGs. MPSGs should identify an outcome/behavior, not a process.

In the “strengths” box, list the student’s strengths, in sentence format. Strengths should be specific to the goal category
and emphasis should be placed on what the student can do; even though it is still a challenging area of learning.

Secondary IEPs with transition, indicate the post secondary goal that your annual goal will be (supporting,
education/training, employment or independent living (if applicable)). For example, writing (education/training)

Example Statements:
●​ Reading: STUDENT can retell the beginning and end of a story at DRA level 16.
●​ Behavior: STUDENT on-task behavior has increased from 50% of the time to 75% of the time. He/She is using a
mini-schedule to keep himself/herself on track.
In the “needs” box, list the student’s needs, in sentence format. Needs should be specific to the goal category and
emphasis should be placed on skills the student has “not yet” mastered, but in which he/she is working to gain proficiency.
Example Statements:
●​ Reading: On a recent oral retelling sample, (STUDENT) included 8 out of 15 main events, with 5 out of 15 events
in the correct sequence at DRA Level 16. (STUDENT’s) understanding affects his/her comprehension
performance in the general curriculum.
●​ Behavior: (STUDENT’s) teachers rated his/her on-task behavior the lowest in math class. He/She scored 40% of
the time on task in math due to his/her frustration with multiple-step math concepts.
In the “goal needed” box, select “No” if the IEP goal has been met, or if the IEP goal is no longer considered a priority
need. Select “Yes” if the IEP goal area is necessary and if the IEP goal is relevant to current programming. For students
who have needs that are being addressed by MTSS interventions, see this document: MTSS for Students in Special

Example Statements:
●​ The IEP team determined STUDENT is eligible for transportation to and from the school in the attendance area
due to the nature of the student’s disability.
●​ STUDENT is eligible for transportation to and from the school in the attendance area. At this time, the
parents/guardian have chosen to provide transportation.
○​ (Mark "yes" student qualifies and in the minutes section enter "0" minutes then write in the narrative:
"Student qualifies for transportation, but parents have chosen to transport.")
●​ STUDENT is eligible for transportation to and from the school in the attendance area. However, since
parent/guardian chose for the STUDENT to attend a school outside of the attendance area, the parent/guardian
provides transportation.

Related Services

Select each of the services needed and accessed by the student during the school year. Create a separate line for each
related service.
Definition: Related services also include school health services and school nurse services, social work services in schools,
and parent counseling and training. Related services do not include a medical device that is surgically implanted (including
cochlear implants), the optimization of that device’s functioning (e.g., mapping), maintenance of that device, or the
replacement of that device. This definition does not limit the right of a child with a surgically-implanted device (e.g.,
cochlear implant) to receive related services as listed in this definition that are determined by the IEP team to be necessary
for the child to receive FAPE;, or limit the responsibility of a school district to appropriately monitor and maintain medical
devices that are needed to maintain the health and safety of the child, including breathing, nutrition, or operation of other
bodily functions, while the child is transported to and from school or is at school; or prevent the routine checking of an
external component of a surgically-implanted device to make sure it is functioning properly.
​
Nursing Support
Invite a school nurse to IEP meeting. Consult with the school nurse regarding minutes. Minutes may be daily, weekly,
monthly, quarterly, or annually. If students need more than 200 minutes of nursing services or if a physician’s order
requires a licensed nurse to be present at the building site, contact the health service supervisor.
New IEPs or New to the District - If parents are discussing skilled nursing care at enrollment, consult school nurses prior
to enrollment.
Educational Support for Students Requiring Continuous Nursing Support Guidance:
1. Treatment nurses may assist the students they support with educational needs if the IEP manager deems that this is
appropriate to the student’s individual health plan.
2. The nurse would need to have the necessary training to provide this assistance.
3. The student’s educational plans will be in writing and additional adult support will be provided during times of transfers
and toileting.
4. This educational support will be provided only if there are no other ongoing health needs to address with the student at
that time.

they are needed in order for the child to succeed in regular education.)
Accommodations: Testing accommodations are changes in testing procedures meant to allow students to demonstrate
what they know and are able to do. When choosing accommodations, the goal is to obtain scores that accurately reflect a
student's knowledge and skills, not to unfairly inflate the student's scores. Accommodations do not change what is being
measured, or the difficulty of the assessment.

Extended School
Year

The team
considered the
need for ESY

Purpose of ESY: ESY is a service to prevent the loss of critical skills that may take substantial time to recover during the
next school year, and ESY is to facilitate maintenance of skills during extended periods of time when school is not in
session. Critical Skills are essential to the attainment of self-sufficiency and independence from caregivers. It is directly
related to the student’s disability, is identified in the IEP, and is considered on an annual basis. The skill must be
appropriate for the individual and must impact the student’s ability to remain in the least restrictive environment.
